# Requestly

Submitted for UOttaHack 7 Gadget Challenge

## Project Description

Built using the new Gadget development platform, Requestly provides a way for users to find eager volunteers in their community to help with their odd jobs. Using React for the frontend and GraphQL as well as JavaScript for the backend, this web app allows users to create job listings for their jobs and to accept others' listings as well.
